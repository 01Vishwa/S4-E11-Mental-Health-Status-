# S4-E11-Mental-Health-Status

2024 Kaggle Playground Series Overview
Competition Goal:
The objective is to analyze a mental health survey dataset to explore factors associated with depression. Participants will predict a binary target class (either 'e' or 'p') representing the presence of depression based on various features.

Files Provided:

  - train.csv: The training dataset with a binary target variable.
  - test.csv: The test dataset for which predictions must be made.
  - sample_submission.csv: An example of the required submission format.

This repository, titled Kaggle Playground Series 2024 - Mental Health Survey Analysis, focuses on predicting depression based on a synthetic mental health survey dataset. It contains thorough data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling efforts utilizing various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and XGBoost. Additionally, the project includes insightful visualizations created with Matplotlib and Seaborn, as well as code to prepare predictions for submission, all aimed at enhancing model performance and contributing to the Kaggle competition.
